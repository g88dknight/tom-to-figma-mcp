## üß™ Testing Deployment

Once deployment is complete (check build logs), test services:

### Test 1: Relay Service
```bash
curl -I https://relay-production-bcbf.up.railway.app
```
**Expected:** HTTP 200 OK with body "Tom Talk to Figma MCP socket relay"

### Test 2: MCP Server
```bash
curl https://mcp-server-production-4ddc.up.railway.app
```
**Expected:** HTTP response from MCP server

### Test 3: WebSocket Connection
```bash
# Using wscat (install: npm install -g wscat)
wscat -c wss://relay-production-bcbf.up.railway.app
```
**Expected:** Connection successful, system message received

## üìã Next Actions

1. **Monitor Build Progress**
   - Open build log URLs above
   - Wait for "Build successful" and "Deployment live" messages
   - Typical build time: 3-5 minutes

2. **Verify Services**
   ```bash
   # Check if relay is responding
   curl https://relay-production-bcbf.up.railway.app

   # Check if MCP server is responding
   curl https://mcp-server-production-4ddc.up.railway.app
   ```

3. **Configure Figma Plugin**
   - Open Figma plugin settings
   - Set WebSocket URL: `wss://relay-production-bcbf.up.railway.app`
   - Set Channel: `default`
   - Connect and test

4. **Test End-to-End**
   - Connect MCP client (IDE) to `https://mcp-server-production-4ddc.up.railway.app`
   - Open Figma document
   - Try calling an MCP tool (e.g., `get_document_info`)
   - Verify command executes in Figma

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If services show 404 errors

This is normal during initial deployment. Wait 5 minutes and retry.

If errors persist:

1. **Check build logs on Railway dashboard**
   - Visit project URL: https://railway.com/project/96cd2005-f86f-4468-b84e-1c05f384f351
   - Click on each service
   - Check "Deployments" tab for errors

2. **Common build issues:**
   - Missing dependencies: Check `package.json`
   - Bun installation failed: Railway should auto-install Bun
   - Dockerfile errors: Verify `Dockerfile` syntax

3. **Redeploy if needed:**
   ```bash
   # Redeploy relay
   railway service relay
   railway redeploy

   # Redeploy MCP server
   railway service mcp-server
   railway redeploy
   ```

### If WebSocket connections fail

1. Ensure relay is using WSS (not WS) protocol
2. Check auth token matches in both services
3. Verify CORS settings in relay
4. Check Figma plugin console for errors
